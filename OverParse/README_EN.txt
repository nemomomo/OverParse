Thank you for downloading OverParse (and for opening this README). OverParse is designed to be fairly painless and simple, so I haven't included a manual here: poke around in the menus and everything should be fairly self-explanatory. If you're having problems, some common solutions are below.
-----

SETUP:

Open the program and follow the prompts. Don't worry, it's not complicated.

-----

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- OverParse doesn't launch at all
Disable your antivirus before launching, or add OverParse.exe to your AV's whitelist.

- PSO2 drops frames / runs slower with OverParse active
This is a Windows problem with layered windows: move OverParse off your game, or disable the Always On Top option in the Window menu.

- I don't see my damage, and the status bar says "No logs"
Check your pso2_bin folder for a folder named "damagelogs". If there are no new files in that folder, you haven't installed the damage dump plugin. You can reset OverParse from the Help menu and try again.
If there are files in that folder, then you've picked the wrong folder in OverParse (this can happen if you somehow installed the game twice). You can reselect your pso2_bin folder from the Help menu.

- I have a problem that's not listed here
Post about it in the PSO-World thread, submit an issue on GitHub, or message me on Discord.
